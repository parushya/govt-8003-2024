    "text": "WTH is \\(\\LaTeX\\)?\n\\(\\LaTeX\\) (pronounced “LAY-tek” or “LAH-Tek) is a typesetting tool for preparing high-quality professional documents. It is the preferred typesetting tool used in high-end scientific documentation task. Essentially, it allows you better control over how your document look like, has enhanced capabilities to write technical specifications (Maths, stats, proofs, etc.), and produces readily editable back-end documents.\nIt is not a word-processing tool. It is a simple tool without too many priors about how the document should look like.\nIn academic world there are definite advantages to learning and being comfortable with \\(\\LaTeX\\). That would require regular use and best time to start doing that would be today (or at least next week!).\nThere are many interfaces that allow you to work with \\(\\LaTeX\\). Overleaf is a widely used online platform and Texmaker is a popular offline application.\nHowever, RStudio has in-built capability to double as a \\(\\LaTeX\\) editor. Previously RMarkdown and now Quarto are those capabilities that you can harness to achieve professional and beautifully typeset documents.\nThink of writing an equation like:\n\\[\nViolence_{i,j} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1EthnicFractionalization_i + \\gamma_j + \\epsilon_i\n\\] In Latex, using quarto, you have to write something like the following:\n$Violence_{i,j} = \\\\beta_0 + \\\\beta_1EthnicFractionalization_i + \\\\gamma_j + \\\\epsilon_i$\nFor a single line of text we encapsulate code by $ sign.\nFor multi-line code we use $$.\nRead more about \\(\\LaTeX\\) here\nThe box folder has some detailed resources for helping with typesetting in \\(\\LaTeX\\).",

Literate statistical programming, as Donald Knuth (1984) defines, is a way to write programs that focuses on explaining to human readers what we want the computers to do, rather than just instructing the computers to do so.\nQuarto can include code from not just R, but also Python, Julia, Stata and many other languages/tools.\nQuarto allows you to truly include the good coding guidelines that we discussed on day 1. It provides you with capability to write code using R, write text that is part of any professional communication, and include mathematical symbols and equations in a well typeset format. Essentially, it allows you to work on a manuscript with data analysis at one place.\nHere is some cool stuff that you can do with quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\nOpen a new quarto document by File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document.\nUse Render button on top on scripts panel to save and get a .pdf output.",

You can edit this file in two ways: Programmatically by being in source button and visually by choosing the Visual button, both button on top left corner of the .qmd window.

Democracy and Trade Policy in the Developing Countries.” International Organization 59 (1): 107–43. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877880.\n\nAbstract:\nRising international trade flows are a primary component of globalization. The liberalization of trade policy in many developing countries has helped foster the growth of these flows. Preceding and concurrent with this move to free trade, there has been a global movement toward democracy. We argue that these two trends are related: democratization of the political system reduces the ability of governments to use trade barriers as a strategy for building political support. Political leaders in labor-rich countries may prefer lower trade barriers as democracy increases. Empirical evidence supports our claim about the developing countries from 1970-99. Regime change toward democracy is associated with trade liberalization, controlling for many factors. Conventional explanations of economic reform, such as economic crises and external pressures, seem less salient. Democratization may have fostered globalization in this period.\nEstimation\nThe following code is not needed for exercise today.

The detailed course material is available on the Canvas Page.\nYou can find here all the code, links to replication data, and notes from the lab session. We will be using R for all the analysis work in this course.\nI will update the session wise pages as we go through them.\nEveryone should have the following on their systems:\n\nR - Statistical Programming Language.\nRStudio - Interactive Development Environment for R.\n\\(\\LaTeX\\) (pronounced “LAY-tek” or “LAH-Tek) Typesetting tool for preparing high-quality professional documents.\n\nYou can check the installation of \\(\\LaTeX\\) for R by following the instructions here.\nIt would be useful if you are familiar with tidyverse framework. If not, or if you need a refresher, the online book here by Hadley Wickham is a great resource.\nLet’s begin!",
